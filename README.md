##Information
`JWFolders` is a class that attempts to mimic the folder animation present on the iOS SpringBoard.  This is my first public repository, as well as my first open-source class, so mistakes were most likely made.  Apologies.

##Preview
`JWFolders` is being used in my commercial app, QuickWeather.  Here's what it looks like in real use:

##Usage
Just include the entire folder, `JWFolders`, in your project.  Import `JWFolders.h` in the class in which you wish to create the folder.

    #import "JWFolders.h"

In the header there is complete documentation.  Alternatively, you can see the demo project for an example.

##ToDo
Quite a bit.  Currently, the animation start is somewhat delayed, and should receive some significant optimization.  Please feel free to fork the project and improve it as much as possible!
