{"name":"JWFolders","body":"## Information\r\n`JWFolders` is a class that attempts to mimic the folder animation present on the iOS SpringBoard.  This is my first public repository, as well as my first open-source class.\r\n\r\n## Preview\r\n`JWFolders` is being used in my commercial app, [QuickWeather](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quickweather/id414898317?mt=8).  Depicted here is a beta version of the app:\r\n\r\n![ExampleFolder](http://www.appjon.com/assets/QuickWeather_folder.png)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nJust include the entire folder, `JWFolders`, in your project.  Import `JWFolders.h` in the class in which you wish to create the folder.\r\n\r\n    #import \"JWFolders.h\"\r\n\r\nIn the header there is complete documentation.  Alternatively, you can see the demo project for an example.\r\n\r\n## ARC\r\nThe project currently uses [Automatic Reference Counting](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html), which means that if your project does not use ARC there will be memory leaks.  There are no plans to create a non-ARC branch at this time.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n`JWFolders` is licensed under the [BSD License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license).\r\n\r\n## ToDo\r\n- Add a \"notch\" at the folder position\r\n- Optimize the speed at which the folder opens\r\n\r\n Please feel free to fork the project and improve it as much as possible!\r\n\r\n## About Me\r\nI'm an 18-year-old developer and designer with a passion for great interface design and detail.  See my [applications](http://appjon.com/applications.html), learn more [about me](http://appjon.com/about.html), or [get in touch](http://appjon.com/support.html).","tagline":"Classes that attempt to imitate SpringBoard's \"folders\"","google":"UA-20499410-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
